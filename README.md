# US Mortality and Healthcare Service Analysis

## [Project Overview]
This project analyzes mortality trends in the United States by examining the leading causes of death and evaluating the availability of healthcare facilities relative to state populations. The primary objective is to determine whether medical facilities are equitably distributed across states and how this correlates with population size and mortality rates.

## [Problem Statement](#problem-statement)
Healthcare access and mortality rates vary significantly across different states. Some regions experience disproportionately high mortality rates with limited healthcare facilities. This project seeks to identify gaps in healthcare provision and assess whether existing hospitals are adequately serving their populations.

## [Purpose](#purpose)
- Identify the leading causes of death in each state.
- Evaluate the relationship between population size, hospital availability, and mortality rates.
- Highlight states with significant service gaps where additional healthcare investments may be necessary.
- Provide insights to policymakers, researchers, and investors to facilitate equitable healthcare distribution.

## [Dataset](#dataset)
The dataset includes:
- **State-wise Mortality Data:** Number of deaths categorized by leading causes.
- **Population Data:** Population estimates for each state.
- **Hospital Availability Data:** Number of hospitals in each state.
- **Mortality Rate Data:** Deaths per 100,000 people per state.
- **Merged Mortality Data:** Consolidated information i.e State, Leading Causes, Total Deaths.Total Population, Total Hospitals 
- **Filtered Mortality Data:** Total Deaths.Total Population, Total Hospitals

## [Target Audience](#target-audience)
- **Policymakers:** Ensure fair distribution of medical resources.
- **Researchers:** Analyze correlations between mortality, healthcare access, and population density.
- **Investors:** Identify service gaps for healthcare infrastructure expansion.
- **Logistics and Medical Suppliers:** Optimize distribution of medical resources.
- **Complementary Healthcare Services:** Support groups, dietitians, therapists, and other specialists addressing non-medical mortality factors.

## [Analysis and Insights](#analysis-and-insights)
### [Findings](#findings)
- **Leading Causes of Death:**
  - Heart disease (23% of total deaths)
  - Cancer (21% of total deaths)
  - Respiratory diseases (8%)
- **States with Highest Mortality Rates:**
  - West Virginia: 947 deaths per 100k
  - Mississippi: 899 deaths per 100k
  - Alabama: 765 deaths per 100k
- **Hospital Availability Disparities:**
  - California: 0.89 hospitals per 100k residents
  - Texas: 1.12 hospitals per 100k residents
  - West Virginia: 1.5 hospitals per 100k residents
- **Investment Opportunities:**
  - Mississippi (High mortality, low hospital availability: 1.3 hospitals per 100k)
  - Rural regions with limited healthcare infrastructure

### [Supporting Data](#supporting-data)
- Correlation analysis between population size, hospital count, and mortality rates.
- Visualization of healthcare service distribution.
- Geographical disparities in leading causes of death.

## [Conclusion and Recommendations](#conclusion-and-recommendations)
### [Conclusion](#conclusion)
There are significant disparities in healthcare accessibility across the United States. States with higher mortality rates tend to have fewer hospitals per capita, highlighting an urgent need for better healthcare infrastructure in certain regions.

### [Recommendations](#recommendations)
- **Increase Healthcare Investment:** Target states with high mortality and low hospital availability.
- **Policy Interventions:** Strengthen healthcare accessibility through funding and regulatory measures.
- **Expand Complementary Services:** Diet and therapy support services for disease prevention and management.
- **Further Research:** Examine specific demographic factors influencing mortality rates.
