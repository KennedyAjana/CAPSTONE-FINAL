### Project Overview:

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the mortality rates and the distribution of medical facilities across the United States, with the ultimate aim of identifying regions in need of improved healthcare accessibility. The specific features integrated into the project will include:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering mortality data from reputable sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and healthcare facility information from relevant databases.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensuring that the data is in a usable format, including handling missing values and outliers.
- **Data Analysis:** Identifying leading causes of mortality, correlation between mortality rates and healthcare accessibility, and regional disparities.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive and static visualizations to convey findings; examples include bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pie charts.
- **Reporting:** Compiling recommendations for stakeholders aimed at addressing healthcare gaps based on the findings.



### Technical Insight:

**Tools & Technologies:**

1. **Programming Language:** 
   - **Python:** Main programming language for data analysis and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. **Data Visualization Libraries:**
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static visualizations.
   - **Plotly:** For creating interactive visualizations that can be displayed on dashboards.

3.


This project plan serves as a roadmap for analyzing mortality rates and healthcare accessibility in the United States. By following this structured approach, I aim to ensure thoroughness in data analysis, clarity in reporting, and effectiveness in communicating insights to stakeholders. I look forward to mentor feedback to refine the plan further.

# US Mortality and Healthcare Service Analysis

## [Project Overview]
This project analyzes mortality trends in the United States by examining the leading causes of death and evaluating the availability of healthcare facilities relative to state populations. The primary objective is to determine whether medical facilities are equitably distributed across states and how this correlates with population size and mortality rates.

## [Problem Statement](#problem-statement)
Healthcare access and mortality rates vary significantly across different states. Some regions experience disproportionately high mortality rates with limited healthcare facilities. This project seeks to identify gaps in healthcare provision and assess whether existing hospitals are adequately serving their populations.

## [Purpose](#purpose)
- Identify the leading causes of death in each state.
- Evaluate the relationship between population size, hospital availability, and mortality rates.
- Highlight states with significant service gaps where additional healthcare investments may be necessary.
- Provide insights to policymakers, researchers, and investors to facilitate equitable healthcare distribution.

## [Dataset](#dataset)
The dataset includes:
- **State-wise Mortality Data:** Number of deaths categorized by leading causes.
- **Population Data:** Population estimates for each state.
- **Hospital Availability Data:** Number of hospitals in each state.
- **Mortality Rate Data:** Deaths per 100,000 people per state.

 ## Data Sources:
   - **CDC Mortality Data:** For mortality statistics.
   - **HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration):** For obtaining data on hospitals and healthcare facilities

## [Target Audience](#target-audience)
- **Policymakers:** Ensure fair distribution of medical resources.
- **Researchers:** Analyze correlations between mortality, healthcare access, and population density.
- **Investors:** Identify service gaps for healthcare infrastructure expansion.
- **Logistics and Medical Suppliers:** Optimize distribution of medical resources.
- **Complementary Healthcare Services:** Support groups, dietitians, therapists, and other specialists addressing non-medical mortality factors.

## [File Formats](#file-formats)
- **CSV (.csv):** Dataset containing mortality rates, population, and hospital data.
- **Python Scripts (.py):** Analysis and visualization scripts.
- **README (.md/.txt):** Project documentation.

## [Packages Used](#packages-used)
- **pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **matplotlib & seaborn:** Data visualization.
- **numpy:** Numerical analysis.
- **scipy:** Statistical analysis.

## Reporting Tools:**
   - **Jupyter Notebooks:** For documenting code, visualizations, and analysis in an interactive environment.
   - **Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides:** For presentations to communicate findings to stakeholders.

## [Analysis and Insights](#analysis-and-insights)
### [Findings](#findings)
- **Leading Causes of Death:**
  - Heart disease (23% of total deaths)
  - Cancer (21% of total deaths)
  - Respiratory diseases (8%)
- **States with Highest Mortality Rates:**
  - West Virginia: 947 deaths per 100k
  - Mississippi: 899 deaths per 100k
  - Alabama: 765 deaths per 100k
- **Hospital Availability Disparities:**
  - California: 0.89 hospitals per 100k residents
  - Texas: 1.12 hospitals per 100k residents
  - West Virginia: 1.5 hospitals per 100k residents
- **Investment Opportunities:**
  - Mississippi (High mortality, low hospital availability: 1.3 hospitals per 100k)
  - Rural regions with limited healthcare infrastructure

### [Supporting Data](#supporting-data)
- Correlation analysis between population size, hospital count, and mortality rates.
- Visualization of healthcare service distribution.
- Geographical disparities in leading causes of death.

## [Conclusion and Recommendations](#conclusion-and-recommendations)
### [Conclusion](#conclusion)
There are significant disparities in healthcare accessibility across the United States. States with higher mortality rates tend to have fewer hospitals per capita, highlighting an urgent need for better healthcare infrastructure in certain regions.

### [Recommendations](#recommendations)
- **Increase Healthcare Investment:** Target states with high mortality and low hospital availability.
- **Policy Interventions:** Strengthen healthcare accessibility through funding and regulatory measures.
- **Expand Complementary Services:** Diet and therapy support services for disease prevention and management.
- **Further Research:** Examine specific demographic factors influencing mortality rates.
